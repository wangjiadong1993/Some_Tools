Some_Tools
==========
Here are some useful tools that I have wrote during those boring days. Maybe useful tools for you.
But you must have a ruby environment on your PC/Linux/Mac

**BiliBili**

BiliBili is a video website well-known in China, this app can be used to download the DanMu(弹幕). 

Note: Because Bilibili changes the JS code sometimes, I will update the code ASAP also.

The tool for downloading the video is still in process


**Wifi**

This is done as a preparation work for my next sem's project, lol.
Basically, you can use it as a Wi-fi positioning tool. My work is still in process. 

Step 1: (which is you have seen here). The return result is just the statistic data about the strength of each AP of a certain Wifi network.
