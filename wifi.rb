#this file is about Wifi AP detection
#WARNING:   this is for OSX !!! 
#WARNING:  before using it, you should have a symbol link from airport app to the .../bin dir
#for n times, the computer detects the strength of the several routers (of the same ssid, in the example, is NUS, customizable, can be nil) 
#n is customizable
#at the end, it shows the report about each AP of the same WIFI network
#from the result, we can notice that, once your computer is still, the strength is quite stableï¼Œjust a little bit fluctuation
#this can be used for wifi positioning once you know the location of each AP
